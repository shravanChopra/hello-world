# hello-world
Hi, fellow humans!

My name is Shravan Chopra. I'm from India, and I came to the US in early 2017 to finally realize my childhood dream of becoming a game developer. I'm currently pursuing a Masters Degree in Game Programming at DePaul University, Chicago. 

My dream is to, one day, work for one of the biggest game companies out there (can't say which!). During the course of my degree, I hope to learn as much as I can about outside of class, and populate this space with some (hopefully) cool and impressive projects. While I'm primarily focused on game programming, I also like to mess around with iOS SDK's and build random iPhone apps. 

Due to my Computer Science background, I've also worked on academic projects involving Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Facial Recognition, Database and Search Engine Development, and some Android development as well. I'm most fluent in C++, C#, C, Swift and Python (in that order, seriously), but am also fairly comfortable with Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and SQL.

(For anyone that's interested, I also fiddle about with the guitar, write some short stories and poetry, and play lots of FIFA :D )

See you guys out there! For future perusers of my projects, I hope I have something fun to show you :)

Cheers!

-S
